Convergent Morphological Evolution in Squamate Reptiles
========================================================

This document includes all code required to generate the figures and results presented in our manuscript.

(1) load dependencies

```{r}
library(geometry)
library(geiger)
library(pcaMethods)
library(MASS)
library(TreeSim)
```

Get the trait data. This assumes that the file "squamorph_v2.csv" is in the working directory indicated below; change that for your local machine.

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
# get trait data
sqMorphA<-read.csv("squamorph_v2.csv", na.strings=c("", " ", "."))

# pull out just continuously distributed characters
sqMorphContinuous<-sqMorphA[1:384, 4:26]

species<-as.character(sqMorphA[1:384, 1])
```
